## Overview

In this challenge the goal was to make a dashboard to calculate the commissions of the sales staff from a chatbot company. 



## Summary

There are very specific calculations of how the sales staff earn their commissions. Depending of different factors individual commissions and group commissions are add up under certain range. Also, incentives and other bonuses were calculated. Once the calculations are ready is very easy to elaborate a Dashboard to mesure in real-time the performance by staff or sales unit. 


For this challenge I used mainly Data Studio as is free and very easy to deploy to all staff members, reducing cost compared to Tableau or PowerBI.


Although, I also prepared a Tableau version with the same data. My personal preference is still Data Studio as collaboration is easier on their platform.


You can download the Tableau workbook from this repository or visit the online dashboards:

- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/YaloChallenge/DashboardSalesPerformance?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)

  

## Steps

1. Data calculation in Google spreadsheet (Excel for Tableau version)
2. Testing
3. Connection to Data Studio (Tableau via Excel)
4. Data Visualization setup
5. Dashboards with the most significant data



## Results

Both dashboards ([Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/5e177c9d-108f-4e30-a5b9-d3623be04282) & [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/YaloChallenge/DashboardSalesPerformance?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link)) offer real-time Data Visualization with all specific calculations of their commissions. HR staff and management can check on any device (Data Studio) their data, allowing them to follow-up with the sales staff and take quick actions.
